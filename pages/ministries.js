                The Deacon is a man called to service - a response to Christ&#39;s call. An ordained minister of the Church, the Deacon receives the sacrament from his Bishop, although he typically reports and supports the ministry of the local pastor. The Deacon is the servant of Christ and the people of God. In addition to assisting the priest, the Deacon is empowered to administer certain sacraments and preside at prayer services and devotions. By this public witness, the Deacon shows that the substance of faith is not something that only exists withing the church walls.
